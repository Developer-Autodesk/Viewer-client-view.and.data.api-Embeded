# client-embedded-view.and.data.api

The simplest way to add a 3D viewer into your website.

## Update

Now you have more convenient way to embed your 3D content into your own website, go to [Autodesk360] (http://autodesk360.com), upload your model and share it, you will get the iframe HTML code. Copy and paste the code snippet to your website; that's it. So this sample is retired. It is not maintained any more. 


## Description

*This sample is part of the [Developer-Autodesk/Autodesk-View-and-Data-API-Samples](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/autodesk-view-and-data-api-samples) repository.*

If all you want is to embed a 3D viewer into your website, the simplest way is demonstrated in this sample.

Limitation: It is difficult to get the viewer object and manipulate the viewer with viewer client side API. If you want to have more control of the viewer, you should consider adding viewer with viewer client API and div tag.


## Dependencies

You need to use other workflow samples to upload and translate files and retrieve the resulting urn, e.g., [workflow-donet-winform-view.and.data.api](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/workflow-donet-winform-view.and.data.api).


## Setup/Usage Instructions

* Get your consumer key and secret key from http://developer.autodesk.com

* Upload and translate your models and get urn
* Set urn in default.aspx.cs
